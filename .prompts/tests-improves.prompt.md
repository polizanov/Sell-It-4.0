Improve e2e tests. I want the first tests to be focussed for correct views for empty database (correct view for no created products, favourite page where user doesent like producds yet, profile page of the user who doesent create products yet) - this tests must be started furst because the database is empty at the beginning. Then test products listings after creaction product test.
