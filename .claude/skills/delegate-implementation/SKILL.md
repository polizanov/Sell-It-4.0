# Delegate Implementation

Decompose tasks into non-overlapping sub-problems and delegate each to the appropriate expert running in isolation.

## Core Principle

**Every implementation task must be decomposed and delegated.** Do not implement directly. Instead:

1. Break down into non-overlapping sub-problems (maximum 5)
2. Identify the expert for each sub-problem
3. Execute subagents (with concurrency limits)

## Step 1: Decompose the Task

Break the task into **non-overlapping sub-problems** (maximum 5):

- **Non-overlapping**: Sub-problems should not conflict with each other
- **Self-contained**: Each sub-problem can be completed and verified by the expert

### Decomposition Guidelines

1. **Separate by stack**: Backend work vs Frontend work
2. **Separate by feature boundary**: Distinct capabilities become separate sub-problems
3. **Keep it coarse**: Aim for 1-5 sub-problems, not too granular steps

## Step 2: Identify Expert per Sub-problem

For each sub-problem, determine the expert:

| Expert              | When to Use                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Expert**  | Server-side logic, API endpoints, business rules, data persistence, validation, background processing, authentication/authorization |
| **Frontend Expert** | visual components, client-side state, presentation logic, form handling, navigation, client-side implementation                     |
| **UI-UX Designer**  | User interface, user interactions, visual components design ideas                                                                   |
| **QA Expert**       | Server-site and client-site testing, unit, integration, e2e tests                                                                   |

## Step 3: Execute Subagents

Run #tool:runSubagent tool, instructing the agent to work autonomously over the given sub-problem.

### Execution

Execute subagents for each sub-problem, ensuring their work stays non-conflicting.

**Simultaneous execution is allowed only when BOTH are true:**

1. **Non-overlapping implementation work**: No shared files, components, or shared state that could conflict.
2. **Different expert types**: The subagents are different experts.

**Exception (Allowed): Backend + Frontend may work simultaneously against the same API** as long as the API protocol/contract is explicitly agreed upfront (routes, request/response payloads, error shapes, and auth assumptions) and treated as the source of truth.

**Hard rule: never run two subagents of the same expert type simultaneously.**

- ✅ May run simultaneously: **Backend Expert** + **UI-UX Designer** + **QA Expert** (including when coordinating on the same API via an agreed contract)
- ✅ May run simultaneously: **Backend Expert** + **Frontend Expert** + **QA Expert** (including when coordinating on the same API via an agreed contract)
- ❌ Must not run simultaneously: **Backend Expert** + **Backend Expert**
- ❌ Must not run simultaneously: **Frontend Expert** + **Frontend Expert**
- ❌ Must not run simultaneously: **UI-UX Designer** + **UI-UX Designer**
- ❌ Must not run simultaneously: **UI-UX Designer** + **Frontend Expert**
- ❌ Must not run simultaneously: **QA Expert** + **QA Expert**

If there are dependencies between sub-problems (e.g., UI depends on an API contract), execute the prerequisite sub-problem first.

### Subagent Prompt Structure

Each subagent prompt must include:

1. **Sub-problem description**: Clear description of what to implement
2. **Acceptance criteria**: What defines "done" for this sub-problem
3. **Prohibitions**: The subagent should avoid further delegation - it must implement the assigned sub-problem autonomously. Prohibit the subsequent use of this "delegate-implementation" skill.

## Example

Task: "Generate a searchable PDF in the background and allow users to download it from the UI."

### Decomposition

| #   | Sub-problem                                                                                                           | Expert         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------|
| 1   | Define the API contract (endpoints, DTOs, errors) for downloading a searchable PDF                                    | Backend        |
| 2   | Add a file-conversion implementation to generate searchable PDFs, plus the required background operation and executor | Backend        |
| 3   | Introduce a new user action: "download_searchable_pdf"                                                                | Backend        |
| 4   | Implement the "download searchable PDF" endpoint (wired to the background operation and conversion output)            | Backend        |
| 5   | Elevate the user experience for the interface, making application more intuitive, accessible, and delightful to use.  | UI-UX Designer |
| 6   | Add the "Download Searchable PDF" UI (button/action + download flow)                                                  | Frontend       |
| 7   | Implement unit, integration, e2e, performance, security tests for the Backend and Frontend functionality              | QA Expert      |
| 7   | If the task is for update remove old tests only for updated element and keep new ones                                 | QA Expert      |
| 8   | Run the tests and return errors to the appoprites subagents for fixing                                                | QA Expert      |

### Execution

1. Run Backend Expert subagent for sub-problem 1 and treat the output as the source-of-truth API contract.
2. Then start simultaneous execution of:
    - Sub-problem 5 (Frontend Expert), and
    - Sub-problems 2 → 3 → 4 (Backend Expert).
3. Backend sub-problems (2 → 3 → 4) execute sequentially due to the concurrency limitation (no Backend + Backend parallelism).

## Guardrails

- **Always decompose first**: Never implement directly without decomposition
- **Maximum 5 sub-problems**: Keep decomposition coarse, not granular
- **Concurrency limitations**: Never run same expert types simultaneously; Backend + Frontend may run simultaneously when implementation work is non-overlapping (API contract coordination is allowed if agreed upfront)
- **Experts validate internally**: Each expert runs their own guardrails
